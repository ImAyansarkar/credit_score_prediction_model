HI! Everyone, 
This is a Credit Score Prediction Model based on Machine Learning Algorithms like Random forest, logistic Regression. 
Process involved in this project are: 

	Data Collection:
•	Gather relevant data from reliable sources. This may include historical credit reports, financial statements, employment records, and other factors that influence creditworthiness.

	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
•	Clean the data by addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Convert categorical variables into numerical representations through encoding. Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale.

	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Conduct EDA to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and explore correlations. This step helps in gaining insights into the data and informing feature selection.


	Feature Selection:
•	Choose the most relevant features that contribute significantly to predicting creditworthiness. Feature selection techniques may include statistical tests, correlation analysis, or machine learning-based methods.

	Model Selection:
•	Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for credit scoring. Common algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. Consider ensemble methods for improved performance.

	Model Training:
•	Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected model(s) on the training set using labelled data (credit scores). Adjust hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

	Model Evaluation:
•	Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. Fine-tune the model if necessary to improve performance.


	Validation and Cross-Validation:
•	Validate the model on an independent dataset if available. Perform cross-validation to assess the model's robustness and generalization to new data.

	Interpretability and Explain ability:
•	Depending on the model complexity, consider methods for interpreting and explaining predictions. This is important for transparency, especially in industries with regulatory requirements.

	Deployment:
•	Deploy the model into a production environment, integrating it with the systems used by lending institutions. Ensure that the deployment adheres to privacy and security standards.

As of now we've currently being deployed it on streamlit, very soon we gonna make it a perfect deployment through website or app.
